# University Progression Prediction System

## About the Project
The University Progression Prediction System is a 1st year Python program designed to help students predict their progression outcomes at the end of each academic year based on their performance in various modules. The program prompts the user for the number of credits they have achieved at pass, defer, and fail levels, and then determines their progression outcome accordingly. This project aims to streamline the process of predicting progression outcomes for individual students, providing them with valuable insights into their academic standing.

## Features
- Prompting users for the number of credits achieved at pass, defer, and fail levels.
- Determining the progression outcome based on the provided credits.
- Providing clear and concise feedback regarding the progression outcome (progress, trailing, module retriever, or exclude).

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/university-progression-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd university-progression-prediction
   
4. Run the program by executing the Python script:
   python progression_prediction.py
   
6. Follow the prompts to input the number of credits achieved at pass, defer, and fail levels.

7. View the predicted progression outcome displayed by the program.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Data
The program uses the following data to predict progression outcomes:
- Number of credits achieved at pass level
- Number of credits achieved at defer level
- Number of credits achieved at fail level
